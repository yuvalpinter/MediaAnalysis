# MediaAnalysis
Extraction and analysis of data from Israeli news sites

This project contains code and data used for the analysis of headlines in the following Israeli news sites:
ynet, Israel Hayom, Haaretz, Maariv, nrg, Mako, walla.

Sequentially, we have the following:
- Headline Extraction: given a directory structure such as the one in data/html-dir-sample, create a single line record for each single headline per site, replacing immediate duplicates (lingering headlines) with the number of consecutive timestamps they appeared in. Location: media_analysis.mining.ExtractTitlesFromHtml
    - Compatible with html formats of all sites starting July 1, 2014, except: Maariv (Aug. 27, 2014), Haaretz (Nov. 25, 2014), and Walla (Jan 25, 2015).
- Tokenization addition: given the output of previous step, run Lucene's Hebrew Morphological Analyzer (part of the hspell project - Harâ€™el and Kenigsberg, 2012) and append each line with a tokenized version. Location: media_analysis.nlp.AddTokenization
- DATA: full output of the code so far, under data/tok-cann-all-headlines.txt
- Auxiliary data: WORDLIST's (Hermit Dave) corpus count of Hebrew tokens (frequency >=5), under data/wordlists-freqs-2012.txt
- Auxiliary data: Linzen 2004's corpus count of Hebrew lemmata (frequency >=5), under data/israblog-freqs.txt
- Feature extraction in Weka format from DATA, using auxiliary tables, under media_analysis.features.NewsOutletPredictorFeatureExtractor (full documentation to follow). Demo configuration file in conf/conf.txt
- Weka format feature files under data. Best-performing feature set with Weka's RandomForest on default parameters under data/weka-cann-out-4538.arff, and performance summaries under data/4538-summary.txt

Notes:
- Consult .classpath for external resources to be downloaded and included (jsoup, lucene + hebmorph, weka)
- build.xml can be run to produce a JAR file which, when put in a directory alongside jsoup, can be used to extract titles from an HTML file dir structure via script.
